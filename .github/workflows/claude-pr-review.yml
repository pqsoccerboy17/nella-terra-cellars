            Review this pull request for:
            1. Code quality - Clean, readable React components with Tailwind utility classes
            2. Routing and SPA correctness - React Router usage and GitHub Pages SPA compatibility
            3. Animation quality - Framer Motion usage (performance, accessibility, reduced motion support)
            4. Deployment safety - Ensure changes don't break GitHub Pages deploy or base path configuration
            5. Potential bugs - Logic errors, edge cases, null checks
            6. Security issues - XSS, injection, exposed secrets, unsafe patterns
            7. Project conventions - Check CLAUDE.md for project-specific conventions

            Be concise and actionable. Focus on issues that matter, not style nitpicks.
            If the PR looks good, say so briefly.
